description: OG2 falcon9 mission
earthrotation: 407.6614278 # in m/s at equator
#launchazimuth: 35 # degres between north and R trajectory
launchlatitude: 28.3922 # cap canaveral
orbitinclination: 51.6 # ISS incl
orbitinsertion: 192500
burnout: 552

# cos(inclination) = cos(lat) * sin(azimuth) 
# from a given latitude, if we want to launch a payload to a particular orbit inclination, 
# we need to calculate the launch azimuth angle given by the formula: 
#       azimuth angle = arcsin[cos(inclination)/cos(latitude)]
