description: OG2 falcon9 mission
earthrotation: 407.6614278 # in m/s at equator
launchlatitude: 28.3922 # cap canaveral

# Orbit Inclination angle is between equatorial plane and orbital plane. From the desired inclination
# and the launch latitude, we can calculate the azimuth angle the rocket has to follow to reach an orbit
# with that inclination
#orbitinclination: 53.2 # starlink incl

# Note that the inclination CANNOT be less than the launchpad latitude
orbitinclination: 28.3922 #97.89 # polar

# Orbit Insertion is the target orbit
#orbitinsertion: 190000
injectionangle: 0
payloadmass: 13620 #3050 # SAOCOM 1B

#orbitinclination: 51.6 # ISS incl

# cos(inclination) = cos(lat) * sin(azimuth) 
# from a given latitude, if we want to launch a payload to a particular orbit inclination, 
# we need to calculate the launch azimuth angle given by the formula: 
#       azimuth angle = arcsin[cos(inclination)/cos(latitude)]
